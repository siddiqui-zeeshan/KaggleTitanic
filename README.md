# Kaggle Titanic
I participated in the competition hosted on Kaggle in which one has to predict the survival of people on board based on a number of criteria given in the dataset. A variety of tasks were involved which included cleaning and structuring of data, feature engineering, data visualisation and finally creating a machine learning model to make predictions on the test data. 
I used a decision tree classifier for making predictions. The libraries used are:
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikitlearn
